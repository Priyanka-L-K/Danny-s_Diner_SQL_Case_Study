# 🍣 Danny’s Diner SQL Case Study  

## 📌 Overview  
Danny’s Diner is a small Japanese restaurant that collects **basic transactional data** from its customers. The goal of this project is to **analyze customer spending, visit patterns, and the impact of a loyalty program** using SQL.  

As an SQL Developer, I wrote **efficient, optimized SQL queries** to extract meaningful business insights, helping Danny improve his restaurant’s performance and customer retention strategies.  

## 🌊 Business Objectives  
Danny wants to answer the following key questions using SQL:  
- 🔢 How much has each customer spent at the restaurant?  
- 📊 What are the **most popular** and **most valuable** menu items?  
- 🍽️ What was the **first item purchased** by each customer?  
- 🗓️ How many times did each customer visit the restaurant?  
- 🌟 How does the **loyalty program** affect customer behavior?  
- 💎 How many reward points has each customer earned?  

## 🛠️ Skills & Techniques Demonstrated  
- **SQL Joins** (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)  
- **Aggregation** (SUM, COUNT, AVG)  
- **Window Functions** (RANK, ROW_NUMBER)  
- **Date Calculations** (Identifying first purchases, tracking membership status)  
- **Conditional Logic** (CASE WHEN for rewards calculation)  
- **Data Transformation & Business Insights**

- The **loyalty program encouraged repeat visits**, especially after customers joined.  

### 3️⃣ **Loyalty Program Effectiveness**  
- Some customers **spent more after joining the loyalty program**, indicating a positive impact.  
- Members **earned double points** in their first week, further incentivizing purchases.
